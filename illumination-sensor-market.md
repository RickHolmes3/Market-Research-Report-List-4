<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Illumination Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Back-Illuminated Sensor</li><li>Front-Illuminated Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Illumination sensors are classified into two main types: back-illuminated sensors and front-illuminated sensors. Back-illuminated sensors have the light-sensitive elements positioned at the back of the sensor, allowing for higher sensitivity and better performance in low-light conditions. On the other hand, front-illuminated sensors have the light-sensitive elements positioned at the front, which may result in lower sensitivity but offer a cost-effective solution. Each type has its advantages and is used in various applications based on the specific requirements of the users.</p></p>
