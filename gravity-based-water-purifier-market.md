<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gravity-based Water Purifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Gravity-based Water Purifier</li><li>Automatic Gravity-based Water Purifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gravity-based water purifiers are divided into two main types based on their operation: manual and automatic. Manual gravity-based water purifiers require the user to physically fill the upper chamber with water, which then filters down through the purification system. On the other hand, automatic gravity-based water purifiers have a mechanism that fills the upper chamber automatically, making the purification process more convenient for the user. Both types offer a simple and effective way to purify water without the need for electricity.</p></p>
