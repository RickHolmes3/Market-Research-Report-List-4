<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extensometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Extensometers</li><li>Non-contact Extensometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extensometers are devices used to measure strain or deformation in materials under tension or compression. Contact extensometers physically touch the specimen being measured, providing accurate readings but potentially causing damage or interference. Non-contact extensometers use optical, capacitive, or other technologies to measure strain without directly touching the material, offering non-invasive measurement but potentially sacrificing some accuracy. Both types of extensometers have their own advantages and limitations, making them suitable for different applications in various industries.</p></p>
