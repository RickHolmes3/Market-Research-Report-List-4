<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Acuity Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High acuity ventilators are divided into two main types - non-invasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators deliver oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs, making them suitable for patients who can breathe independently but need additional support. Invasive ventilators involve the insertion of a tube into the patient’s airway, typically used for patients who require more advanced respiratory support. Both types play a crucial role in providing respiratory assistance to patients with severe respiratory conditions.</p></p>
