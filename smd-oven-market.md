<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SMD Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Oven</li><li>Vapour Phase Oven</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SMD oven market types include convection ovens and vapor phase ovens. Convection ovens use hot air to evenly distribute heat throughout the oven, which makes them popular for SMD reflow processes. Vapor phase ovens, on the other hand, use a vaporized fluid with a high boiling point to transfer heat to the components, ensuring a more uniform and controlled reflow process. Both types of ovens are essential in SMD manufacturing for achieving precise and reliable results.</p></p>
