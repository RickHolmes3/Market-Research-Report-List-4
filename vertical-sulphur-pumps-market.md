<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Sulphur Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-stage Pump</li><li>Single-stage Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical sulphur pumps are commonly categorised into two main types based on their design and functionality. Multi-stage pumps are designed to generate higher pressures by using multiple impellers to increase the pump's efficiency. On the other hand, single-stage pumps are simpler in design and are typically used for lower pressure applications. Both types of pumps are crucial in industries where the pumping of sulphur is required, such as in chemical processing plants or refineries.</p></p>
