<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HPLC Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversed-Phase</li><li>Normal-Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HPLC columns are essential components used in chromatography for separating and analyzing compounds. Reversed-phase columns are the most commonly used type, where non-polar stationary phase and polar mobile phase are used to separate compounds based on their hydrophobicity. On the other hand, normal-phase columns use a polar stationary phase and a non-polar mobile phase to separate compounds based on their polarity. Both types offer different selectivity and separation mechanisms, catering to a wide range of analytical needs in various industries.</p></p>
