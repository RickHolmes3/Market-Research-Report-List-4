<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paper Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Paper Sheet Capacitors</li><li>Metalized Paper Capacitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Paper capacitors are capacitors that use paper as a dielectric material. There are two main types of paper capacitors: paper sheet capacitors and metalized paper capacitors. Paper sheet capacitors consist of alternating layers of paper and aluminum foil, while metalized paper capacitors have a thin layer of metal deposited directly onto the paper. Both types of capacitors offer high capacitance values and are commonly used in oscillators, filters, and other electronic applications.</p></p>
