<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial fans are commonly categorized into two main types: Centrifugal Fans and Axial Fans. Centrifugal fans work by drawing air into the fan housing and then expelling it in a different direction, making them ideal for applications requiring high pressure and airflow. Axial fans, on the other hand, operate by moving air parallel to the fan's shaft, making them suitable for applications requiring high airflow but lower pressure. Both types of fans are commonly used in industrial settings to control ventilation, temperature, and air circulation.</p></p>
