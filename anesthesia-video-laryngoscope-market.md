<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes have a built-in channel in the blade which allows for the easy insertion of the endotracheal tube, making intubation simpler and faster. On the other hand, Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes do not have a channel in the blade, requiring a separate tool to guide the endotracheal tube into the airway. While channelled laryngoscopes offer convenience and efficiency, un-channelled laryngoscopes may provide more flexibility and control during intubation procedures. Both types cater to different preferences and requirements in the anesthesia market.</p></p>
