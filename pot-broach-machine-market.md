<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pot Broach Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Pull</li><li>Spiral Pull</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pot broach machines are classified into two main types: straight pull and spiral pull. In straight pull machines, the cutting tool moves in a straight motion to remove material from the workpiece. On the other hand, spiral pull machines utilize a spiral motion of the cutting tool for material removal. Straight pull machines are commonly used for simple keyways, while spiral pull machines are more versatile and can be used for more complex shapes and profiles. Both types have their own advantages and are suited to different machining requirements.</p></p>
