<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Universal Expansion Joint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pipe End Type</li><li>Flange Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Universal expansion joints are crucial components in piping systems to absorb thermal expansion, vibration, and misalignment. Two common types of universal expansion joints in the market are pipe end type and flange type. Pipe end type joints connect to piping systems directly with welded ends, while flange type joints connect via flanges. Pipe end type joints are preferred for simpler installations and lower pressure applications, while flange type joints offer greater flexibility in system design and are suitable for higher pressure applications. Both types play a vital role in ensuring the integrity and longevity of piping systems.</p></p>
