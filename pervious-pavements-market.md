<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pervious Pavements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pervious pavements are a sustainable solution for managing stormwater runoff. The market for pervious pavements can be divided into two types: powder and liquid. Powder pervious pavements are typically made from cementitious materials that allow water to infiltrate through the pavement surface. Liquid pervious pavements, on the other hand, consist of permeable resins that create a porous surface for water to pass through. Both types of pervious pavements help reduce water runoff and minimize flooding, making them increasingly popular in urban areas.</p></p>
