<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless Sensor Tags Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Tags</li><li>Passive Tags</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active tags in the wireless sensor tags market are electronic devices that have their own power source (such as a battery) and can actively transmit data to a central system without relying on external sources. Passive tags, on the other hand, do not have their own power source and rely on an external source (such as a reader) to power them and collect data. Active tags are typically used for tracking high-value assets or in real-time monitoring applications, while passive tags are more cost-effective and commonly used for inventory management and item tracking.</p></p>
