<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Glucose Test Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase</li><li>Glucose Oxidase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Blood Glucose Test Paper Market consists of two main types of technology: Glucose Dehydrogenase and Glucose Oxidase. Glucose Dehydrogenase technology is based on the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase, which converts glucose into gluconolactone, causing a color change on the test paper. Glucose Oxidase technology, on the other hand, utilizes the enzyme glucose oxidase to oxidize glucose into gluconic acid, resulting in a color change reaction. Both technologies are commonly used in blood glucose monitoring devices for individuals with diabetes.</p></p>
