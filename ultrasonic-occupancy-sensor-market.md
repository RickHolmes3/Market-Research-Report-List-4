<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Occupancy Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wired</li><li>Wireless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic occupancy sensors are available in two main market types: wired and wireless. Wired occupancy sensors require a physical connection to a power source and a central control unit, making installation more complex but typically more reliable. On the other hand, wireless occupancy sensors are easier to install as they do not require physical connections, relying instead on wireless technology to communicate with a central control unit. Both types offer the benefits of efficiently detecting occupancy and controlling lighting or HVAC systems in commercial and residential buildings.</p></p>
