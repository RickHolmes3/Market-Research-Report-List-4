<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RTD Resistance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-wire RTD</li><li>Three-wire RTD</li><li>Four-wire RTD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RTD resistance market types include two-wire, three-wire, and four-wire RTDs. Two-wire RTDs are the simplest and most cost-effective option, but they are susceptible to lead resistance errors. Three-wire RTDs offer better accuracy by compensating for lead resistance variations. Four-wire RTDs are the most accurate, as they have two pairs of wires - one for current supply and the other for voltage measurement. They are ideal for precision measurements in industries where accuracy is paramount.</p></p>
