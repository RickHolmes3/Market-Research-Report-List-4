<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flanged V Port Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft Seal Valve</li><li>Hard Seal Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flanged V Port Ball Valves are classified into two main market types based on their sealing mechanism: Soft Seal Valve and Hard Seal Valve. Soft Seal Valves use flexible materials like rubber or elastomers to create a tight seal, making them ideal for applications where leakage prevention is crucial. On the other hand, Hard Seal Valves utilize metal-to-metal contact for a more durable seal, suitable for high-pressure or high-temperature environments. Both types offer reliable performance, but their suitability depends on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
