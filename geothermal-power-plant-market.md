<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power plants can be classified into three main types: dry steam stations, flash steam power stations, and binary cycle stations. Dry steam stations use steam directly from the ground to drive turbines and generate electricity. Flash steam power stations separate steam from hot water and use it to generate power. Binary cycle stations utilize hot water from geothermal reservoirs to heat a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which then drives turbines. Each type of geothermal power plant has its own advantages and applications in the renewable energy market.</p></p>
