<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Temperature Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distributed</li><li>Non-distributed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber optic temperature monitors are available in two main market types - distributed and non-distributed. Distributed temperature monitors use a continuous fiber optic cable to measure temperature along its length, making them suitable for long-distance monitoring. Non-distributed temperature monitors, on the other hand, use discrete sensors at specific points to measure temperature, offering more localized and precise monitoring. Both types have their own advantages and applications, depending on the specific monitoring requirements of the user.</p></p>
