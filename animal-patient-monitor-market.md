<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Patient Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Animal patient monitors are essential devices that allow veterinarians to closely monitor vital signs during surgical procedures or when animals are under anesthesia. There are two main types of animal patient monitors: invasive and non-invasive. </p><p>Invasive monitors involve inserting sensors directly into the animal's body to measure parameters such as blood pressure or oxygen levels. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, use external sensors to gather information without penetrating the skin or tissues. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and well-being of animals during medical procedures.</p></p>
