<p><h1>Choroidal Neovascularization Market Size and Growth, Market Segmentation, Regional and Country Breakdowns, and Market Trends for Period from 2024 -  2031</h1></p><p><strong>Choroidal Neovascularization Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a common cause of vision loss in individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It occurs when new blood vessels grow abnormally beneath the retina, leading to leakage of blood and fluids that can damage the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision.</p><p>The Choroidal Neovascularization Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.00% during the forecast period. The market growth is being driven by increased prevalence of AMD, as well as advancements in diagnostic techniques and treatment options for CNV. The development of novel therapies, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs, has significantly improved outcomes for patients with CNV.</p><p>Furthermore, rising healthcare expenditure, growing awareness about eye disorders, and increasing geriatric population are also fueling the market growth. Technological advancements in imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), are aiding in early detection and management of CNV.</p><p>Overall, the Choroidal Neovascularization Market is witnessing steady growth, with a focus on innovative treatment approaches and improved patient outcomes.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choroidal Neovascularization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intravitreal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) can be treated through two main methods: Intravenous (IV) therapy and Intravitreal injections. Intravenous therapy involves delivering medication directly into the bloodstream through a vein, while intravitreal injections involve injecting medication directly into the eye. Both methods aim to target and inhibit the abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid, reducing fluid leakage and vision loss associated with CNV. These treatments are crucial in managing the progression of CNV and improving patients' visual outcomes.</p></p>
