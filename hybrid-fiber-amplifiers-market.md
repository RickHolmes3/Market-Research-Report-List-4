<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Fiber Amplifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distributed Hybrid Fiber Amplifier</li><li>Lumped Hybrid Fiber Amplifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hybrid Fiber Amplifiers are categorized into two main types - Distributed Hybrid Fiber Amplifiers and Lumped Hybrid Fiber Amplifiers. Distributed amplifiers use a long span of fiber with multiple amplification sections, providing higher gain and lower noise figure. On the other hand, Lumped amplifiers use discrete amplification sections placed at intervals within the fiber. Distributed amplifiers are more suitable for long-distance transmission systems while Lumped amplifiers are preferred for shorter distances where space constraints are a concern.</p></p>
